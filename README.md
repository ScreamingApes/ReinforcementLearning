# Reinforcement Learning
Project for Machine Learning class at Roma Tre University.

We implemented the agent for several gym's environment ([Taxi](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/), [Cart Pole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/), [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/), [Lunar Lander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/)), using:
* Q-learning
* Deep Q-learning
* Double Deep Q-learning

You can find the final report [here](ReinforcementLearning.pdf).
